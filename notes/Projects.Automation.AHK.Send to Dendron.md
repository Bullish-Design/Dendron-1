## Title
Create AHK connection for Dendron Enhancements

## Description

System wide enhancements for Dendron via AutoHotKey. Modular system, easily adaptable based on program/window context. Easily customizable and modifiable. Goal is starting out with a RMB flyout menu to offer some options. Get that working first, then start thinking about context functionality. 

## Goal
<!-- What are you trying to accomplish -->

## Context
<!-- Related Projects - Ideally build this into an automated "what's this building on/leading to" filler spot -->

## Success Criteria

## Sub Projects
<!-- For larger projects, list out sub projects related-->
- AHK content creator/logger ("WorkMode")
    - Launches required programs if not open. 
    - Goes by what project/Task is open in Dendron (if it meets project/task requirements)
    - Floating Icon in bottom right showing task tree, timer updates, notifications, previous/next task, New note button, new task button, big ol done with task button
    - Tracks interactions (mouse button, highlight, click, log what window, time, active task, active project, etc)
    - Logs interactions with computer to log file

- Dendron Actions
    - New task shortcut
    - New Project shortcut
        - project templates option
    - AHK RMB menu tree 
        - Save to active task as note, 
        - Save as reference for new task
        - etc (make flexible and modular as possible for easy adaptation later)
    - Dendron formatting + VS code script to save-as into a properly formatted file with proper file suffix in pre-determined folder location
