 ****Simply** Unbeatable**"**The numbers look great and the bounce rates are astonishingly low. There’s a lot to be said for the targeting in your list. Great job!**" --Premium accessory company.

"**I can't believe MOTO sent 1,000 people to our site.**" --E-moto brand.

"**It only took 1 mention of our latest promo on MOTO to send 25 riders to dealers for a test ride. This is incredible targeting.**" --Premium Euro motorcycle brand.

The "bounce rate" terminology in sponsor No. 1's statement may not be consumer-friendly, but it means unlike a FB or IG ad that may bring in random clickers or a press release that may entice just a few, MOTO's readers are not only all riders, but are the right target audience for premium branded products. Bounce Rate means how long a visitor stays on your site.

The reason it was a surprise (if not a shock) to sponsor No. 2 to see those numbers (1,000 plus visitors) is because premium brands' press releases hardly ever get any clicks when shared on typical motorcycle news sites. That's because these sites attract all sorts of riders who are typically on much older bikes. Many of their readers keep talking about the good old '60s. Nothing wrong with either of those types, except it will not help you sell a new premium accessory, let alone a bike or an expensive e-moto. It's that simple.

The case of the sponsor No. 3 is equally pertinent (dealer test rides). It takes a great deal of effort to motivate people to not only notice your promo, but to also click on it. This is why typical click rates by the other guys hover around 0.1%. It's many times more challenging to get people to leave their homes and actually go to a retailer because of an online promo for a premium and expensive product (vs deep bargains and mass market goods). 25 bodies on seats at dealers from 1 promo in 1 publication is incredible for a small but ultra premium Euro brand.

**1,000 Potential Visitors in 4 Days is Unbeatable - Not Even Google Ads Can Compete**There aren't any options we're aware of that could potentially send 1,000 targeted, qualified buyers to your site in only 4 days--except for MOTO. That's the magic of MOTO eMagazine. Our sponsors are not only getting massive exposure by having their brands on MOTO, they also receive a burst of clicks to their sites within just a few days after release of the issue.
