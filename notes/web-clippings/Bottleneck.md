 **Friction Between Product and Engineering**; Lack of trust and collaboration slowing down product growth

The key to any successful startup is close collaboration between product and engineering. This sounds easy, but can be incredibly difficult. Both groups may have conflicting goals and different definitions of success that have to be reconciled. Engineering might want to build a product that is perfectly scalable for the future with the best developer experience. Product might want to quickly validate their ideas, and put features out that will entice customers to pay for the product. Another example that’s common to see is an engineering-led "engineering roadmap" and a product-led "product roadmap" and for the two to be completely independent of each other, leading to confusion for product engineering. These two mindsets put two parts of your organization at odds. The easy path is to skip the difficult conversations and operate within silos, coming together infrequently to deliver a release. We believe that aligning these two disparate organizations into cohesive team units removes organizational friction and improves time to value.

How did you get into the bottleneck?
------------------------------------

At the beginning of a startup’s journey, aligning is natural because you are a small team working closely together, and likely the product and tech leaders had close personal relationships before the company was founded. The initial startup idea is very strong and as it quickly gains traction, what to work on next is obvious to all groups. As the company grows, however, skill-based verticals begin to appear with more layers of management, and these managers don’t always put the effort in to create an effective working relationship with their peers. Instead, they focus on urgent tasks, like keeping the application running or preparing for a funding round. At the same time, the startup faces a critical juncture where the company needs to to decide how to best invest in the product, and needs a holistic strategy for doing so.

Well-run startups are already working in cross-functional product teams. Some functions will naturally work well together because they fall under the same vertical hierarchy. An example would be development and testing — well integrated in startups, but often siloed in traditional enterprise IT. However, in the scaleups we work with, we find that product and technical teams are quite separated. This happens when employees align more with their function in an [Activity Oriented](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ActivityOriented.html) organization rather than with an [Outcome Oriented](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OutcomeOriented.html) team, and it happens at every level: Product managers are not aligned with tech leads and engineering managers; directors not aligned with directors; VPs not aligned with VPs; CTOs not aligned with CPOs.

Ultimately, the bottleneck will be felt by reduced organizational performance as it chokes the creation of customer and business value. Startups will see it manifest in organizational tension, disruptive exceptions, unchecked technical debt, and velocity loss. Fortunately, there are some key signs to look for that indicate friction between your product and engineering organizations. In this article we will describe these signs, as well as solutions to lower the communication barriers, build a balanced investment portfolio, maximize return on investment, and minimize risk over the long term.

Signs you are approaching a scaling bottleneck
----------------------------------------------

### Finger pointing across functions

![](https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/hierarchical-communication.png)

Figure 1: Friction across a typical hierarchical structure

Team members align themselves with their management structure or functional leadership as their primary identity, instead of their business or customer value stream, making it easier for teams to assume an “us” versus “them” posture.

At its worst the “us vs them” posture can become truly toxic, with little respect for each other. We have seen this manifest when product leaders throw requirements over the wall, and treat the engineering team as a feature factory. They might abruptly cancel projects when the project doesn’t hit its outcomes, without any prior indication the project wasn’t meeting its KPIs. Or conversely, the engineering team continually lets down the product team by missing delivery dates, without warning that this might happen. The end outcome is both sides losing trust in each other.

### Engineers often stuck due to lack of product context

When product managers pass off features and requirements without reviewing them with the engineers (usually within the constructs of a tool like Jira), critical business and customer context can be lost. If engineers operate without context, then when design or development decisions need to be made, they must pause and track down the product manager, rather than make informed decisions themselves. Or worse, they made the decision anyway and build software based on an incorrect understanding of the product vision, causing time delays or unused software. This friction disrupts flow and introduces undue waste in your delivery value stream.

### Missed dependencies

When engineers and architects operate with minimal context, the full scope of a change can be overlooked or misunderstood. Requirements or user stories lack depth without context. Customer personas can be ignored, business rules not taken into consideration, technical integration points or cross-functional requirements missed. This often leads to last minute additions or unintended disruptions to the business or customer experience.

### Work slipping between the cracks

Tasks slipping between the cracks, team members thinking someone else will be responsible for an activity, team members nudging each other out of the way because they think the other team member is operating in their space, or worse, team members saying “that’s not my job” – these are all signs of unclear roles and responsibilities, poor communication and collaboration, and friction.

### Technical debt negotiation breakdown

Technical debt is a common byproduct of modern software development with many root causes that [we have discussed previously](https://martinfowler.com/articles/bottlenecks-of-scaleups/01-tech-debt.html). When product and engineering organizations aren’t communicating or collaborating effectively during product planning, we tend to see an imbalanced investment mix. This can mean the product backlog leans more heavily towards new feature development and not enough attention is directed toward paying down technical debt.

Examples include:

*   Higher frequency of incidents and higher production support costs
*   Developer burnout through trying to churn out features while working around friction
*   An extensive feature list of low quality features that customers quickly abandon

### Teams communicating but not collaborating

Teams that meet regularly to discuss their work are communicating. Teams that openly seek and provide input while actively working are collaborating. Having regular status meetings where teams give updates on different components doesn’t mean a team is collaborative. Collaboration happens when teams actively try to understand each other and openly seek and provide input while working.

How do you get out of the bottleneck?
-------------------------------------

Eliminating the wall between Product and Engineering is essential to establishing high performing product teams. Cross-functional teams must communicate and collaborate effectively and they must be able to negotiate amongst themselves on how best to reach their goals. These are strategies Thoughtworks has applied to overcome this bottleneck when working with our scaleup clients.

### Identify and reinforce your “First Team”

At its most basic, a product team is a group of individuals who come together in a joint action around a common goal to create business and customer value. Each team contributes to that value creation in their own unique way or with their unique scope. As leaders, it’s important to identify and reinforce a team dynamic around the creation of value rather than an organizational reporting structure. This cross-functional product team becomes a team member’s “first team”. As a leader, when you define your team as your group of direct reports, you are enabling a tribal concept that contributes to an “us vs. them” dynamic.

The First Team mindset was defined [by Patrick Lencioni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPXI2bPZTOo) and referenced in many of his works including [The Advantage](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470941529/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0470941529&linkCode=as2&tag=martinfowlerc-20) and [The Five Dysfunctions Of A Team: A Leadership Fable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787960756/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0787960756&linkCode=as2&tag=martinfowlerc-20), and while it’s typically used in relation with the establishment of cross-functional leadership teams as the primary accountability team rather than organizational reports, the same concept is applicable here for product teams.

Simply changing your organization's language, without changing its behaviors isn’t going to have a measurable impact on your scaling woes. Still, it's a simple place to start and it addresses the organizational friction and larger cultural issues that lie at the root of your performance issues.

#### Changing the language

> The more hands-on an organization is willing to be in breaking silos, the more likely it is they will be effectively be breaking some of the implicit ‘versus’ states that have enabled them.
> 
> \-- [Duena Blomstrom](https://www.forbes.com/sites/duenablomstrom1/2019/02/06/why-a-culture-of-us-vs-them-is-deadly)

Taking a hands-on approach to moderating the language used in your organization is a simple first step to breaking down barriers and reducing friction.

*   Referring to your organizational group of practitioners as anything other than “team” – such as squad, pod, or whatever term fits your organization’s culture is a small change that can have a strong impact.
*   Naming your cross-functional product delivery teams, ideally with the name of their product or value stream, is another simple change that helps these multi-disciplined individuals adopt a new team identity separate from their organizational reporting context.
*   Drop “us” and “them” from the professional vocabulary. Coming up with alternative terms but keeping the same context of ‘that group over there - which isn’t this group’ is cheating. We filter ourselves and our language in a professional environment regularly and this language needs to be added to the ‘not allowed’ list.

#### Change the behavior

> Those of us trying to change our organizations’ culture need to define the things we want to do, the ways we want to behave and want each other to behave, to provide training and then to do what is necessary to reinforce those behaviors. The culture will change as a result.
> 
> \-- [John Shook](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-change-a-culture-lessons-from-nummi/)

Changing an organization’s culture when it isn’t delivering the desired results is hard. Many books have been written on the subject. By defining and communicating the expected behaviors of your teams and their respective team members up front, you set the underlying tone for the culture you are striving to create.

*   Leaders should set a principle and expectation of a blameless culture. When something goes wrong, it’s a wonderful learning opportunity, to be studied and used to continuously improve. An example of this is the concept of a blameless post-mortem.
*   Set expectations and regularly inspect adoption of desired behaviors. Hold team members accountable to these behaviors and refuse to tolerate exceptions.
*   Orient “team” constructs around value streams instead of functions. Differentiate “teams” as groups who deliver common value from Communities of Practices or Centers of Excellence which are typically formed to deepen or deliver specific competencies such as Product Management or Quality Assurance.
*   Acknowledge that some personality types are less compatible than others. Shift talented people around to find the optimal team synergy.

### Define and communicate how your scaleup delivers value

A company is, in many ways, just one large team with one shared goal — the success of the organization. When product and engineering don’t have a shared understanding of that goal, it’s hard for them to come to a collaborative agreement on how to achieve it. To avoid this source of friction, executives must clearly articulate and disseminate the overall value their organization provides to its customers, investors, and society. Leaders are responsible for describing how each product and service in your portfolio contributes to delivering that value. Management must ensure that every team member understands how the work that they do day in and day out creates value to the organization and its customers.

The goal is to create a shared mental model of how the business creates value. The best way to do this is highly dependent on the nature of your business. We have found certain kinds of assets to be both common and useful across our scaleup clients:

#### Assets that describe customer and user value

These should describe the value your product and services create, who they create it for, and the ways you measure that value. Examples include:

*   Business Model Canvas/Lean Canvas
*   User Journeys
*   Service blueprints
*   Personas
*   Empathy maps
*   Storyboards
*   Job forces diagrams
*   Product overviews (one-pagers, etc)

#### Assets that describe your economic model

These should describe the value your company receives from customers, the cost of creating that value, and the ways in which you measure that value. Examples include:

*   Business flywheels
*   Value stream maps
*   Wardley maps
*   Retention/churn models
*   Customer acquisition models
*   Customer lifetime value models
*   Projected balance sheets and income statements

#### Assets that describe your strategy

These should describe why you’ve chosen to serve these customers in this way, the evidence you used to make that decision, and the highest leverage ways you can increase the value you create and the value you receive in return.

*   Target customer profiles
*   Issue trees
*   Impact maps
*   Opportunity/solution trees
*   Hierarchy diagrams
*   Causal loop diagrams
*   Other bespoke frameworks and models

Once you have these assets, it’s important to constantly refer to them in presentations, in meetings, when making decsions, and most importantly, when there is conflict. Communicate when you change them, and what made you make those changes. Solicit updates from the organization. In short, make them part of your normal operations and don’t let them become wallpaper or another cubicle pinup.

A simple heuristic that we’ve found to understand how successful you’ve been in this communication is to pick a random individual contributor and ask them to answer the questions answered by these assets. The better they can do this without referring to the assets, the better they will be at incorporating this thinking into their work. If they don’t even know that the assets exist, then you still have a good deal of work to do.

The alignment and focus these assets create allow for better deployment of organizational resources, which enables scaling. Additionally, they redirect the natural tension between product and engineering. Instead of unproductive interpersonal friction, you can use creating and updating these assets as a venue for true collaboration and healthy disagreement about ideas that strengthen the company.

### Create multidisciplinary stream-aligned teams

When a company is just starting out, it often only has one value stream. But once it grows, it needs to break apart its products and services into multiple value streams so that individual teams can assume full ownership of various products or pieces of products. The best way to do this decomposition is beyond the scope of this article (we personally are big fans of [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/) as a way to think through it), but some key things to consider are:

*   Could this value stream and the products and services it comprises exist as a separate company (even if it wouldn’t be a highly successful one)?
*   Can you align your value streams to a specific way that your company creates value, or to a specific customer or user that the company creates value for?
*   How do your different value streams interact with each other?

After defining your value streams, it’s time to bring multi-disciplined team members together around them — because value creation is a team sport. Ask the leaders of these value streams to create similar but more detailed versions of the assets we discussed above, and then determine what skills and capabilities are routinely needed to deliver and evolve the value of the product(s) and/or service(s) in the value streams from start to finish.

Pool those individuals together into an [Outcome Oriented](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OutcomeOriented.html) team, rather than coordinating work across [Activity Oriented](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ActivityOriented.html) or functional teams. In [Agile IT Organization Design](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0133903354/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0133903354&linkCode=as2&tag=martinfowlerc-20), Sriram Narayam states, “The more process and indirection there is, the greater the friction for effective collaboration. By contrast, people within a team don’t have to schedule meetings to collaborate with each other. They collaborate continuously and get into huddles (informal, ad hoc meetings—virtual or face to face) on demand.” While this model helps reduce latency within outcome-oriented team, it also reduces the friction among multidisciplinary team members.

Keep in mind that as your company grows, you may need to have “teams of teams”, with multiple teams aligned around one value stream and a team of cross-functional leaders for that value stream as well. As the complexity of your value creation increases, so too does the criticality of maintaining common purpose across your product delivery teams.

Product managers and software engineers have a shared responsibility to understand the needs of the customer so that they can define and prioritize the work. There isn’t an ideal mix of product people to engineers; every product is going to have a different ratio. The important part is to know that both are responsible for understanding, prioritizing and creating value.

As the product evolves, the needs of the team will evolve as well. Take regular inventory of the team's capabilities and empower the stream-aligned teams to advocate for their own needs. Ensure that the teams are fully resourced with the staff, skills, information, and authority to deliver efficiently without unnecessary dependencies on external resources. Fully sourced, empowered and autonomous product teams operating as a single entity, regardless of each individual’s reporting structure, dramatically reducing cross-discipline friction.

### Establish team working agreements at all levels

#### Ensure every team member knows what role they’re playing

The best teams are those that have negotiated the best ways of working for themselves. It’s important for organizations to have established sensible defaults to guide less mature teams on how to work effectively as a team. Even with established defaults, it's important that teams have autonomy to decide which member will take on which responsibilities. This measure of autonomy leads to greater accountability and a higher level of intrinsic motivation. As new teams form, codify this working agreement in the team's common knowledge repository. During retrospectives, revisit this team working agreement as the team learns more about each team member’s strengths and weaknesses and reassign the responsibilities accordingly. This team working agreement becomes both the social contract of the team, and also a unique "responsibility fingerprint" that no other team has. As new team members join or rotate through the team, having a referenceable team working agreement accelerates integration and reduces time to value during onboarding.

Team working agreements frequently contain:

*   Team Name: What is the unique identifier for the team?
*   Team Mission: Why does this specific team exist? What value is it expected to deliver?
*   Team Metrics: How will the team measure success? Include value creation metrics, not just activity metrics.
*   Team Responsibilities: What work needs to be done to ensure success and which team members are agreeing to own those work items? _Organizations can seed this work with typical activities and recommendations for team responsibility allocations, but team members are free to renegotiate amongst themselves._
*   Team Skills: What skills are needed on this particular team to ensure success?
*   Team Norms: Guidelines, principles, ceremonies, and/or sensible defaults for team members to align on how team members are expected to behave, interact, and make decisions.

#### Leaders form their own teams

Figure 2: Cross-functional collaboration at all levels

Working agreements are a useful tool for cross functional teams, but they are also a great tool for aligning cross functional leaders.

> These three holistic view leaders—the head of product, the head of design, and the head of technology—are obviously very valuable individually, but in combination you can see their real power.

Executive leaders have a responsibility at a macro level to align on corporate and product strategies and the subsequent measures of success. If executives are not aligned on such measures as “desired investment mix across products”, teams expected to deliver to these measures are not being set up for success.

Functional line managers in a digital product organization may no longer direct the day to day efforts of the stream-aligned team - that responsibility falls to the team and the product manager on that team - but they still have tremendous value. Functional managers are responsible for ensuring that they are providing a healthy bench of skilled players to staff those teams. It’s critical that these direct managers are aligned on the roles and responsibilities of product team members to avoid conflict within the product teams.
