TO CHANGE. But need to figure out functionality/formatting. And work on that ridiculous multi-layer tree to get to each day. 

Maybe have this be more of a passive log? Tracking what was worked on that day by comparing git diffs?

    - "5 subtasks completed: 'List of tasks given here in link format'"
