# Overview
Create a python script to transform a "Code" Dendron template into properly formatted code.  

# Components
## Code Block/Comment switcheroo
Recognize dendron code blocks, turn those into code - everything else turn into comments

## Save output
Use template defined "save" location to save output file as copy

## Link to Output
Provide link to output file to open in VScode or in File Explorer

## Language adaptability
Immediate need for AHK and Python, will need others later

## Block Import
Also copy code blocks into a common code snippet file for each language? 
- And have easy reference to/from this library to make it easier to use/reuse code functions
