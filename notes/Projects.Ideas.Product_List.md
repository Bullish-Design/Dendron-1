Format for list below:
## Idea Name
Brief Description
- Why do it?

# Product Ideas
## Reel to Reel CNC Fabric Cutter
Fabric roll gets rolled onto "takeup" roll, cnc cutter cuts as it goes onto takeup 
-Compact size, takeup roll keeps pieces from falling out of fabric - allow vertical orientation of machine to enable factory operation in small space

## Knockoff Teenage-Engineering Computer Case
Just to see how much it would cost at various volumes: https://teenage.engineering/products/computer-1

Make it in a different size, with slightly different vibes. Maybe a spot for a glass panel. 
- Quote to show different manufacturing methods, positives/negatives of each, different finishing capabilities, materials, etc.
