# Product Idea List
Format for list below:
## Idea Name
Brief Description
- Why do it?

# Product Ideas
## Reel to Reel CNC Fabric Cutter
Fabric roll gets rolled onto "takeup" roll, cnc cutter cuts as it goes onto takeup 
-Compact size, takeup roll keeps pieces from falling out of fabric - allow vertical orientation of machine to enable factory operation in small space

## Knockoff Teenage-Engineering Computer Case
Just to see how much it would cost at various volumes: https://teenage.engineering/products/computer-1

Make it in a different size, with slightly different vibes. Maybe a spot for a glass panel. 
- Quote to show different manufacturing methods, positives/negatives of each, different finishing capabilities, materials, etc. 

## Folding Aluminum Motorcycle Luggage
Much cheaper shipping. There's no reason for a bike pannier to cost $350. Could offer similar capability at half price, easily. Either flat sheet and customer assembled, or actual folding and some sort of snap open functionality (maybe mounting to the bike locks it together?)

Offer kits to work with major luggage manufacturer brands (givi, sw motech, etc), stay out of the mounting kit itself to minimize sku's and R&D.

^ Just don't use an actuator. Ropes between front and back axles?
