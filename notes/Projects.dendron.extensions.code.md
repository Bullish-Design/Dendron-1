# Coding Extension

Maybe not an extension, per se, but something to allow coding inside of Dendron. Utilize code blocks within .md file, and then have an export functionality to "reverse" that. Code blocks become the actual code, and everything else becomes comment blocks. 

## Dendron Template Features
### Frontmatter
- File Export location
- Programming language identifier

## Sub-Functions
### Organize Comment/Uncomment by programming language

### Identify Code Blocks in MD file

### Export File to export location

### Swap code block and comment block
