Welcome to Bullish Design Works - the behind the scenes look into Bullish Design. 

This is an *active* overview of current projects and a repository of documentation for past projects. The site itself is a representation of the Dendron (https://wiki.dendron.so/) vault that holds the thoughts and development that goes on behind the scenes. This is just a spit shined version of what's getting done. 

Check back often to see what's new, what's changed, and what's coming next.
