<p>Welcome to Bullish Design Works - the behind the scenes look into Bullish Design. </p>
<p>This is an <em>active</em> overview of current projects and a repository of documentation for past projects. The site itself is a representation of the Dendron (<a href="https://wiki.dendron.so/">https://wiki.dendron.so/</a>) vault that holds the thoughts and development that goes on behind the scenes. This is just a spit shined version of what's getting done. </p>
<p>Check back often to see what's new, what's changed, and what's coming next. </p>
