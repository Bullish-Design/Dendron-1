<p>TODO Update templates for Weekly Log, Task Note, and Note Note. </p>
<p>Weekly Log:</p>
<p>TO CHANGE. But need to figure out functionality/formatting. And work on that ridiculous multi-layer tree to get to each day. </p>
<p>Maybe have this be more of a passive log? Tracking what was worked on that day by comparing git diffs?</p>
<ul>
<li>Would need categories for organization. 
<ul>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>"1 new project created - 'New project name pulled in here'"</li>
<li>"3 new tasks created in 'Corresponding project name pulled in here'"</li>
<li>"5 subtasks completed: 'List of tasks given here in link format'"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
