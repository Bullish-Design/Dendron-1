TODO Update templates for Weekly Log, Task Note, and Note Note. 

Weekly Log:

TO CHANGE. But need to figure out functionality/formatting. And work on that ridiculous multi-layer tree to get to each day. 

Maybe have this be more of a passive log? Tracking what was worked on that day by comparing git diffs?
  - Would need categories for organization. 
    - Examples:
      - "1 new project created - 'New project name pulled in here'"
      - "3 new tasks created in 'Corresponding project name pulled in here'"
      - "5 subtasks completed: 'List of tasks given here in link format'"
